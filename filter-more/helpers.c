    As we have implemented the previous three filters in the previous filter problem we will be
    be copy pasting their solutions to this. We might optimize a few things here as well.



    Let's think about how we'll implement the edges filter.
    The algorithm for calculating the edges has been provided to us.
    A lot of the things in that algorithm are the same as the blur function so we will
    copy paste the code of blur as much as possible and maybe make a few optimizations as well.
